Key Features:
1. Database Loading Process

Batch Image Processing: Processes multiple images in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor
Object Detection: Uses YOLO 11 to detect and extract objects from images
Feature Extraction: Extracts SIFT features from each detected object
Database Storage: Stores object metadata, features, and relationships in SQLite database
Progress Tracking: Shows real-time progress with tqdm

2. Query Process

Single Image Query: Processes a single uploaded image
Object Extraction: Detects and extracts the main object using YOLO 11
Feature Matching: Uses FLANN to match query features against database
Similarity Ranking: Returns top 10 most similar objects with scores
Original Image Retrieval: Links back to original source images

3. Database Management

SQLite Database: Efficiently stores images, objects, and features
Optimized Schema: Indexed tables for fast querying
Feature Serialization: Stores SIFT keypoints and descriptors as binary data
Statistics: Provides detailed database statistics

Usage Examples:
Load Database:
bash# Load images from a directory into the database
python app.py --mode load --images-dir /path/to/images --class person --confidence 0.5 --workers 4
Query Database:
bash# Query the database with a single image
python app.py --mode query --query-image /path/to/query.jpg --class person --top-k 10
Get Statistics:
bash# View database statistics
python app.py --mode stats
Architecture:
Classes:

DatabaseManager: Handles SQLite operations and schema management
SIFTFeatureExtractor: Manages SIFT feature extraction
FLANNMatcher: Handles feature matching using FLANN
ObjectMatchingApp: Main application orchestrator

Database Schema:

images: Stores original image metadata
objects: Stores detected objects with features and relationships

Key Processes:

Image → YOLO Detection → Object Extraction → SIFT Features → Database Storage
Query Image → YOLO Detection → SIFT Features → FLANN Matching → Top Results
